        <h1>CS 40 Escape Room</h1>

        <p>
            You are in an escape room and are tasked with solving a series of puzzles in order to break out. 
            Doing so may require working solutions of all CS 40 assignments (filesofpix, iii, locality, arith, 
            bomb, um, profiling, and asmcoding) and general knowledge of CS 40 concepts. The challenge begins 
            with the following two files:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="escape_start"><code>escape_start</code></a></li>
            <li><a href="escape_start.c"><code>escape_start.c</code></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Good luck, and have fun! :)
        </p>
