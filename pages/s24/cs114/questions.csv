2,"Suppose that Bill is implementing a password manager system called ByteWarden, where all communications between any users and servers are encrypted using a pre-determined pad \(O\). Specifically, for all messages \(M_i\), the corresponding ciphertext \(C_i\) is determined with the following encryption scheme:
\(C_i = M_i \oplus O\).
Similarly, \(C_i\) can be decrypted with \(M_i = C_i \oplus O\).
Is ByteWarden secure?",MC,,,"Yes, because \(O\) is a one-time pad, and one-time pad offers perfect secrecy.",,"No, because the protocol requires that \(O\) match the size of each message.",,"No, because with knowledge of a given \(M_i\) and \(C_i\), one can compute \(O = M_i \oplus C_i\).",,"No, because with knowledge of two different ciphertexts \(C_1\) and \(C_2\), one can compute \(O = C_1 \oplus C_2\)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
